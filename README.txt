Draw electronic circuits with ASCII characters.

This is a pythonized version of the original (Borland Delphi) AACircuit (by Andreas Weber).
A kind of reverse engineered version, where the idea and GUI layout are taken from the original.

For the ASCII representation, use copy or "Save ASCII". Use a monospaced font in your document, news- or mailclient!

Library: every symbol has to be created for each of the four directions.

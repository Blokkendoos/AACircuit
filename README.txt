Draw circuits using ASCII

This is a pythonized version of the original (Borland Delphi) AACircuit.
A kind of reversed engineered version, where the idea and GUI layout are taken from the original.

For the ASCII representation, use copy or "Save ASCII". Use a monospaced font in your document, news- or mailclient!

Library: every symbol has to be created for each of the four directions.
